# StudyMeta: Interview Prep App

## What and Why?
I want to build a mobile web app called **StudyMeta**. It’s basically an interview prep tracker where you can see **high-yield questions**, question variants, and keep everything in one place. Right now people just search up random stuff, flip through notes, or lose track of progress. This app would make it way easier and less messy.

## For Whom?
It’s mainly for students like us getting ready for job interviews, plus grads and people switching careers. Basically anyone who needs to practice questions and stay organized.

## How?
From the user side, the app would let you:  
- See important high-yield questions  
- Check different ways the same question could be asked  
- Add your own notes to questions  
- Track if you’ve practiced or mastered them  
- Search/filter questions by tags  

## Scope
Seems like a good semester project. Not too small (there’s question management, notes, tracking) but not too complex either. A group of 4–5 could do the main stuff.
